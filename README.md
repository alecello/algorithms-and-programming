# Solutions to Algorithms and Programming problems
This repository contains solutions to the problems posed in the lectures and laboratories of the Algorithms and Programming course held by Stefano Quer at PoliTO for the academic year 2020/2021.

This code is intended to be part of the public domain and can be used by anyone in any form without any obligation.

These are my **personal** solutions to the problems. I do **NOT** guarantee on the correctness, efficiency or quality of this code. If you fail your exam because you looked at my code, **it's entirely YOUR fault**.

The text of the problems are provided by prof. Stefano Quer and are **not** affiliated with me in any way. The solutions are (unless otherwise specified) created by me and are mostly original work, although they can and probably will contain inspiration or snippets from lectures, slides, laboratories, corrections et al.


## VS Code support
VS Code support is included in the repo (since it's the editor I use). The default build task (`CTRL + SHIFT + B` with default keybinds) will rebuild all the applications, whereas the default debug configuration (`F5` with default keybinds) will rebuild the current file only and debug it with gdb.


## License
Do whatever you want with this code. Read it, copy it, modify it, sell it, burn it in a sacrificial ritual. The only thing you **must** keep in mind is that whatever you do with this it's **your** responsibility and I am not to be held liable.

## Special thanks
Thanks to PoliTO, and in particular Prof. Quer and his teaching assistants for teaching me and providing me with exercises.
